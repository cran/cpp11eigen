Targeted primarily at social scientists and other non-programmers, this article explains the computational benefits of moving code to C++ in terms of speed and syntax. We provide a comprehensive overview of Armadillo's capabilities, highlighting its user-friendly syntax akin to MATLAB and its efficiency for computationally intensive tasks. The 'armadillo' package simplifies a part of the process of using C++ within R by offering additional ease of integration for those who require high-performance linear algebra operations in their R workflows. This work aims to bridge the gap between computational efficiency and accessibility, making advanced linear algebra operations more approachable for R users without extensive programming backgrounds.},

It provides the most recent tools for analysis of trade policy using structural gravity models. Written by experts who have contributed to the development of theoretical and empirical methods in the academic gravity literature and who have rich practical experience in the field, this publication explains how to conduct partial equilibrium estimations as well as general equilibrium analysis with structural gravity models and contains practical guidance on how to apply these tools to concrete policy questions. This Advanced Guide has been developed to contribute to the enhancement of developing countries’ capacity to analyse and implement trade policy. It is aimed at government experts engaged in trade negotiations, as well as graduate students and researchers involved in trade-related study or research.},
